# 😷 Kenny's House of Development Disasters 😷
I'm 42 years old, looking to learn programming properly for the first time.  

My goal ultimately is to tinker on personal projects and possibly contribute to some open source projects in the future.

## Some Infos  

🧠 I'm currently learning:
* C#
* Xamrin
* MacOS
* Docker (sort of)
* Notion

🤔 I'm looking for help with:
* Insomnia
* Sanity  

💬 Ask me about:
* My hot takes on Linux

📫 How to reach me:  
  
* [This repositories discussions](https://github.com/kennyh7279/kennyh7279/discussions)
* Email
* Twitter (I hardly post but I'll get the message)
* Blog

⚡️ Fun fact:  
I have been around the world 3 times and nearly everywhere I've gone has had a "Euclid" street somewhere.
